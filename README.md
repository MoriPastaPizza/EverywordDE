# EverywordDE
Hi! This is the source code of the [EverywordDE Bot](https://twitter.com/everywordDE)
It *attempts* to post ~300k German words I found in a word list [here](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/German/words.html).
With English etymology meaning & synonyms!

# Why?
Because it's **fun** And I was inspired by the aweseome [Everyword Bot](https://twitter.com/Everyword)
And maybe some English speakers can learn some German, due too the Etm. Meaning etc. being in English

# Wordlist
The wordlist itself is parsed from [this](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/German/words/kaikki.org-dictionary-German-words.json) Json file **WARNING GIANT FILE INCOMING!**
It's parsed into a more handy smaller list with fewer information (just the info I need for the twitter bot).
Feel free to use this wordlist in any way you want :)

# Build your own?
Sure! Use all the code you want! Just be sure to input your own Twitter-API credentials (twitterCreds.json). And more important: **In the TwitterController.cs file edit the BotTwitterId constant to match your bot id**
